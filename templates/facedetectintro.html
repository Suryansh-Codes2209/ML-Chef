        <h1> <b>First learn about Opencv:-</b></h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. Being an Apache 2 licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.

            The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects, extract 3D models of objects, produce 3D point clouds from stereo cameras, stitch images together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene, find similar images from an image database, remove red eyes from images taken using flash, follow eye movements, recognize scenery and establish markers to overlay it with augmented reality, etc. OpenCV has more than 47 thousand people of user community and estimated number of downloads exceeding 18 million. The library is used extensively in companies, research groups and by governmental bodies.
            
            Along with well-established companies like Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Intel, IBM, Sony, Honda, Toyota that employ the library, there are many startups such as Applied Minds, VideoSurf, and Zeitera, that make extensive use of OpenCV. OpenCV’s deployed uses span the range from stitching streetview images together, detecting intrusions in surveillance video in Israel, monitoring mine equipment in China, helping robots navigate and pick up objects at Willow Garage, detection of swimming pool drowning accidents in Europe, running interactive art in Spain and New York, checking runways for debris in Turkey, inspecting labels on products in factories around the world on to rapid face detection in Japan.
            
            It has C++, Python, Java and MATLAB interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Android and Mac OS. OpenCV leans mostly towards real-time vision applications and takes advantage of MMX and SSE instructions when available. A full-featured CUDAand OpenCL interfaces are being actively developed right now. There are over 500 algorithms and about 10 times as many functions that compose or support those algorithms. OpenCV is written natively in C++ and has a templated interface that works seamlessly with STL containers.

            <li><h3>Computer Vision:</h3></li>
            
            <p>
                Computer vision is a process by which we can understand the images and videos how they are stored and how we can manipulate and retrieve data from them. Computer Vision is the base or mostly used for Artificial Intelligence. Computer-Vision is playing a major role in self-driving cars, robotics as well as in photo correction apps.

          <li><h3>2. UnSupervised Machine Learning:</h3></li>
          
          <p>
          In this case, there is no teacher for the class and the students are left to learn for themselves! So for Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms, there is no specific answer to be learned and there is no teacher. In this way, the algorithm doesn’t figure out any output for input but it explores the data. The algorithm is left unsupervised to find the underlying structure in the data in order to learn more and more about the data itself.

          <li><h3>3. Semi-Supervised Machine Learning:</h3></li>
          
          <p>
          The students learn both from their teacher and by themselves in Semi-Supervised Machine Learning. And you can guess that from the name itself! This is a combination of Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning that uses a little amount of labeled data like Supervised Machine Learning and a larger amount of unlabeled data like Unsupervised Machine Learning to train the algorithms. First, the labeled data is used to partially train the Machine Learning Algorithm, and then this partially trained model is used to pseudo-label the rest of the unlabeled data. Finally, the Machine Learning Algorithm is fully trained using a combination of labeled and pseudo-labeled data.

          <li><h3>4. Reinforcement Machine Learning:</h3></li>
          <br>
           
          <p>
            Well, here are the hypothetical students who learn from their own mistakes over time (that’s like life!). So the Reinforcement Machine Learning Algorithms learn optimal actions through trial and error. This means that the algorithm decides the next action by learning behaviors that are based on its current state and that will maximize the reward in the future. This is done using reward feedback that allows the Reinforcement Algorithm to learn which are the best behaviors that lead to maximum reward. This reward feedback is known as a reinforcement signal.

    <br>
    Unsupervised Machine Learning mainly includes Clustering algorithms. Some of the more popular algorithms in this category are:

      <li><h3>1. K Means Clustering Algorithm</h3></li>
      <p>

        Let’s imagine that you want to search the name “Harry” on Wikipedia. Now, “Harry” can refer to Harry Potter, Prince Harry of England, or any other popular Harry on Wikipedia! So Wikipedia groups the web pages that talk about the same ideas using the K Means Clustering Algorithm (since it is a popular algorithm for cluster analysis). K Means Clustering Algorithm in general uses K number of clusters to operate on a given data set. In this manner, the output contains K clusters with the input data partitioned among the clusters.
      </p>
      <br>
      
      <li><h3>2. Apriori Algorithm</h3></li>
      <p>
        The Apriori Algorithm uses the if-then format to create association rules. This means that if a certain event 1 occurs, then there is a high probability that a certain event 2 also occurs. For example: IF someone buys a car, THEN there is a high chance they buy car insurance as well. The Apriori Algorithm generates this association rule by observing the number of people who bought car insurance after buying a car. For example, Google auto-complete uses the Apriori Algorithm. When a word is typed in Google, the Apriori Algorithm looks for the associated words that are usually typed after that word and displays the possibilities.
